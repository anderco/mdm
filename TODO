On-going tasks:

Aramis: making this list smaller
Felipe: making this list smaller
Lucas:  making this list smaller
Paulo:  making this list smaller

-------------------
Structural changes:

- Ensure that mode-dependent code is outside mdm-core
- Remove 'xrandr-functions' from mdm-core
- Rename the inner 'mdm' directory to 'mdm-core' or 'core'
- Completly remove modes form 'mdm-core' (no more 'default modes')
- Make an 'utils' dir for mode-dependent scripts that can be part of more than
  one mode
- Create a mode that uses multiple X servers. That will probably break some
  things and change the way input devices are configured

-----------------
Easy/small tasks:

- Stop printing needless sections of xorg.conf
- When modes print their Xephyr arguments, they lie
- Verify the bugs reported with RECONFIGURE_INPUT='no'
- Verify the bugs reported with video resolution (xrandr not respecting
  mdm.conf)
- Verify the possible bugs with drivers that use older xrandr versions
- Do some sanity checks in mdm (check mdm.conf's syntax, quit if no mode is
  present, etc)
- Document our dependencies (building and using). Should we add a script to
  detect them?
- Should we install the init.d script with make install?
- Fix init.d's 'Should-Start' (read the comments inside the code)
- Rename 'mdm-bin' to mdm and move the init.d script elsewhere
- Update copyright to 2008 (and 2009)?
- Add a script to make tarball releasess?
- Update our template mode
- Should we try to remove bashisms? (wait for someone to complain?)
- Create a changelog file?

------------------
Medium/hard tasks:

- Replace the ugly makefiles with autotools
- Fix the hardcoded DESTDIRs
- Fix all warnings from debian's lintian check
- Write manpages
- Remove all the unnecessary 'sleeps', wait things the right way
- In xephyr-gdm mode, if you repeatedly kill Xephyr, GDM gives us an error
  message (not the blue screen). Investigate this.
- Find a way to reconfigure input devices in the xephyr-gdm mode
- Create a mode that uses VNC
- Fix the documentation and wiki!
- Find a better way to discover video cards and their drivers
- Create the necessary modes for UFPR (sibi, provas, boca, turma da m√¥nica)
- Investigate -kbd and -pointer arguments (I heard there is a way to set the
  number of mouse buttons there)
- echo "$(egrep -r "(TODO|XXX|FIXME)" *)"


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Things you'll need to commit outside your repository (mainly X work):

- Remove the need for patched libx11 (see fd.o bug #6820)
- Fix the "? /" abnt2 key (in X) (this problem doesn't happen with some
  machines, test in Debian unstable)
- Fix ctrl+alt+backspace in Xephyr
- Remove the need for xorg.conf?
